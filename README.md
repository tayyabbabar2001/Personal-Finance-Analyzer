# Personal-Finance-Analyzer
The Personal Finance Analyzer is a C++ program that helps individuals analyze their financial situation based on their income and expenses. Users can input their income, along with specific expense categories such as grocery, rent, clothing, and other miscellaneous expenses. The program provides feedback on their saving habits.

**Features:**

Income and Expenses Input: The program prompts the user to enter their monthly income, as well as the amounts spent on grocery, rent, clothing, and other miscellaneous expenses.

Calculation: The analyzer calculates the total expenses and the savings amount, which is the difference between the income and total expenses.

Saving Feedback: Based on the calculated savings, the program provides feedback on the user's saving habits.

**How to Use:**

Run the program.
Enter the monthly income when prompted by the console.
Enter the amounts spent on grocery, rent, clothing, and other miscellaneous expenses as requested.
The program will process the input and display the savings feedback.
Savings Feedback:

"Poor Savings": If the calculated savings amount is negative (i.e., expenses exceed income), indicating that the user is not saving enough or is incurring debts.
"Little Saving": If the savings amount is positive but less than 20% of the total income, suggesting the need for improved saving habits.
"Good Savings": If the savings amount is greater than 20% of the total income, indicating a commendable saving behavior.
**Note:**

The Personal Finance Analyzer assumes the user will input valid positive numerical values for income and expenses.
The analyzer uses a 20% threshold as a benchmark for evaluating good saving habits. Users can adjust this threshold based on their financial goals.
